      <h1>Privacy Policy for the Research Chatbot EzBot</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        This website hosts EzBot, an experimental chatbot used in the context of a university research project in the field of digital governance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The chatbot relies on external service providers, in particular OpenAI and Amazon Web Services (AWS), in order to enable the technical
        provision of the service and the generation of responses. The protection of your personal data is a top priority for us.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following information explains how your data are processed when you use the chatbot, in accordance with Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
      </p>

      <h2>1. Controller</h2>
      <p>The controller within the meaning of the GDPR is</p>

        You may also send confidential data protection related inquiries to this email address. The university does not have access to this communication.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Categories of data processed</h2>
      <p>When you use EzBot, the following categories of personal data in particular may be processed</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an access code or passcode assigned to you for this study</li>
        <li>questions and other text entries you submit in the chat</li>
        <li>the responses generated by the chatbot</li>
        <li>timestamps of the individual interactions</li>
        <li>technical basic information required for operation and security, such as shortened or hashed identifiers, session information and error logs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We design the system in such a way that no additional personal data are collected which are not required for the research purpose. In particular</p>
      <ul>
        <li>at the application level, IP addresses are not stored or evaluated on a permanent basis</li>
        <li>server side access logs are reduced to what is strictly necessary for system security and deleted after short periods</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Please note that we cannot control which content you voluntarily enter in the chat. It is therefore possible that you disclose personal data
        or particularly sensitive information in your text entries, for example concerning health, political opinions or other protected areas. We ask you
        to enter such information only if it is necessary for participation in the research project and if you are aware of the associated risks.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Purposes of processing</h2>
      <p>Your data are processed for the following purposes</p>
      <ul>
        <li>implementation of the research project on the use and perception of AI supported chatbots in the field of Digital Governance</li>
        <li>scientific analysis of chat interactions, for example to analyse usage patterns, questions and the quality of responses</li>
        <li>improvement of the functionality, stability and reliability of the chatbot as part of the research project</li>
        <li>ensuring IT security, in particular error analysis, detection of misuse and protection of the systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your data are not processed for advertising purposes or for profiling for commercial purposes.</p>

      <h2>5. Legal bases of processing</h2>
      <p>The processing of your personal data is based on the following legal grounds</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR (consent)</strong><br/>
          Where you consent to the processing of your data for research purposes before using the chatbot, your consent is the legal basis for the processing.
          This applies in particular to the analysis of your chat interactions for scientific purposes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Article 6 paragraph 1 letter e GDPR (performance of a task carried out in the public interest)</strong><br/>
          Freie Universität Berlin is a public university. Research is part of its statutory mandate. To the extent that processing is necessary for the implementation
          of the research project within this mandate, it is based on Article 6 paragraph 1 letter e GDPR in conjunction with the applicable higher education law
          for Freie Universität Berlin.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Because we cannot fully control the content of your text entries, it cannot be ruled out that special categories of personal data within the meaning of
        Article 9 paragraph 1 GDPR are processed, for example data concerning health or political opinions. Insofar as such data are processed, we rely on
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>your explicit consent pursuant to Article 9 paragraph 2 letter a GDPR and</li>
        <li>Article 9 paragraph 2 letter j GDPR in conjunction with the relevant German and state law provisions that allow processing for scientific research purposes under appropriate safeguards.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The provision of your personal data is voluntary. If you choose not to provide data, you will not be able to participate in the study, but you will not suffer any other disadvantages.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. Processing carried out before the withdrawal remains lawful.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Storage of data and location of processing</h2>
      <p>The technical infrastructure for EzBot is operated exclusively in data centres within the European Union.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The web application and the database are hosted on servers of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in EU regions, for example Frankfurt.</li>
        <li>Requests to the language model operated by OpenAI are sent via API endpoints with activated EU data residency so that processing and storage of model requests take place only in data centres within the EU.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We store</p>
      <ul>
        <li>chat data and passcodes in pseudonymised form for the duration of the research project</li>
        <li>thereafter only anonymised or aggregated datasets, for which a link to an individual person can no longer be established by reasonable means, for the purpose of scientific analysis and publication</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Pseudonymised raw data are deleted as soon as they are no longer required for the research purpose. This also includes backups, insofar as they contain personal content.
        Specific retention periods follow from the research plan and the relevant retention rules of Freie Universität Berlin.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Recipients and processors</h2>
      <p>
        Within Freie Universität Berlin, only those persons have access to your data who necessarily require it in order to conduct the research project, in particular members of the research group of Prof. Dr. Kostka.
      </p>

      <p>We use the following processors within the meaning of Article 28 GDPR</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide the server infrastructure and the database in EU data centres</li>
        <li>OpenAI to provide the language model that generates the chatbot responses</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Data processing agreements have been concluded with both service providers that comply with the requirements of Article 28 GDPR. AWS and OpenAI process the data exclusively on our instructions and not for their own purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Research partners outside Freie Universität Berlin are granted access, where necessary, only to anonymised or aggregated datasets which do not allow any conclusions about individual participants.
      </p>

      <p>Your personal data are not passed on for commercial purposes or for advertising.</p>

      <h2>8. Transfers to third countries and Standard Contractual Clauses</h2>
      <p>
        Your data are stored exclusively in data centres within the European Union. Nevertheless, both AWS and OpenAI are corporate groups with their head offices in the United States.
        This means that, in theory, access from a third country may be possible, for example due to administrative activities or legal disclosure obligations in the United States.
      </p>

      <p>For this situation, we rely on the following for any data transfers and access possibilities</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission pursuant to Article 46 paragraph 2 GDPR, which have been concluded with AWS and OpenAI</li>
        <li>with regard to Amazon Web Services, additionally on the fact that Amazon Web Services, Inc. is certified under the EU US Data Privacy Framework</li>
        <li>additional technical and organisational measures, in particular restriction to EU regions, encryption and strict access management</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Despite these safeguards, a residual risk cannot be completely ruled out that authorities in the United States may access data stored in the EU.
        This structural risk cannot currently be completely eliminated when using US based providers. We take this into account in our risk assessment and limit the scope and sensitivity of the data processed as far as possible.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Automated decision making and profiling</h2>
      <p>
        The chatbot uses an AI language model to generate its responses. However, there is no automated decision making within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR
        that produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no profiling aimed at evaluating or classifying you for decisions outside this research project.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Your rights</h2>
      <p>Subject to the statutory conditions, you have the following rights vis à vis Freie Universität Berlin</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Right of access to the personal data concerning you that we process (Article 15 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to rectification of inaccurate or incomplete data (Article 16 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to erasure of your personal data, where there is no legal retention obligation or applicable research exemption (Article 17 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to restriction of processing (Article 18 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to data portability in the cases set out in Article 20 GDPR</li>
        <li>Right to object to processing that is based on Article 6 paragraph 1 letter e GDPR (Article 21 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to withdraw consent that you have granted under Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a or Article 9 paragraph 2 letter a GDPR with effect for the future</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To exercise these rights, you can contact us using the contact details set out in section 1 or contact the Data Protection Officer of Freie Universität Berlin directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR.
        The competent supervisory authority is usually
