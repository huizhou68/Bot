  <h1>Privacy Policy (Datenschutzerklärung)</h1>

  <p>
    This website hosts FuBot, an experimental chatbot developed by researchers specialized in digital governance. The chatbot relies on several external service providers, including OpenAI and Amazon AWS. Its quality of responses is comparable to that generated by mainstream large language models. User privacy has always been a top priority in the development and application of the chatbot.
